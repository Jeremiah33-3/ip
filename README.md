2. Use of AI
   1. IntelliJ code autocompletion
   2. Use of ChatGPT to improve header comments (documentation).
   3. Copilot: enquiries about functions available in JUnit, LocalDateTime Class of Java, and detailed explanations of Java Streams.

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.
